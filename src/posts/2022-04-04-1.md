Sea-Intelligence has published issue 127 of the Global Liner Performance (GLP) report, with schedule reliability figures up to and including February 2022. In a release, it focused on the global highlights from the full report.

“Global schedule reliability improved M/M in February 2022 by 4.0 percentage points, reaching 34.4%, the first significant M/M improvement we have seen in schedule reliability since March 2020. In February 2022, the schedule reliability score was only marginally lower Y/Y. The average delay for LATE vessel arrivals also improved M/M, decreasing by -0.77 days to 7.11 days in February 2022. That said, the delays have now been over 7 days since August 2021, and continue to be the highest across each month when compared historically, as the delay figure for February 2022 was 0.16 days higher Y/Y.

“Maersk was once again the most reliable top-14 carrier in February 2022, with schedule reliability of 47.8%, followed by Hamburg Süd with 42.4%… MSC, CMA CGM and ZIM had schedule reliability between 30%-40%, with 8 carriers recording schedule reliability of 20%-30%... On the other hand, 8 carriers recorded a Y/Y decline in schedule reliability…”
