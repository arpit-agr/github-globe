If the Chinese lockdown restrictions spread, affecting access to the ports as well as workers, as happened in 2020 when Covid-19 measures led to record queues for container ships, analysts fear freight may see a disruption, leading to both bottlenecks and rising freight costs as was seen then. How the current surge impacts China’s supply chains and industrial production will add to the concerns of its major trading partners, including India, which are already preparing to deal with the spillover impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine.

A particular concern is its impact on China’s major ports. Shanghai, the world’s largest, has imposed lockdowns in several neighbourhoods but the port was maintaining normal operations as on March 15. Shenzhen, another major port, is also operating although the city itself has been placed under lockdown, as per a report.
